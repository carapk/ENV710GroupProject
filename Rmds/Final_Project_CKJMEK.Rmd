## MODEL FIT ONE: Dissolved Oxygen by Total Phosphorus with a Seasonal Binary Indicator Variable and a Seasonal Interaction Term

```{r seasonal model, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

two_season_clean <- lakes_processed %>%

two_season_fit <- lm(dissolvedOxygen ~ summer_indicator + tp_ug + summer_indicator*tp_ug,
                     data = two_season_clean)

summary(two_season_fit)

```

a.  What is the estimate of $\beta_0$ and what does it represent in terms of DO (dissolved oxygen)?

$\beta_0$ for this fit is 10.14 mg/L, which represents the expected value of DO in spring with zero total phosphorus.

b.  What is the estimate of $\beta_1$ and what does it represent in terms of DO?

$\beta_1$ for this fit is -2.36, which represents the difference in DO between spring and summer with zero total phosphorus. In summer the expected dissolved oxygen is 8.7 mg/L.

c.  What is the estimate of $\beta_2$ and what does it represent in terms of DO?

$\beta_2$ for this fit is -0.067 (mg/L)/ug, which represents the expected change in DO for each unit increase in total phosphorus during spring.

d.  What is the estimate of $\beta_3$ and what does it represent in terms of DO?

$\beta_3$ for this fit is 0.02 (mg/L)/ug, which represents the adjustment to the slope for each unit increase in total phosphorus during the summer. In the summer the expected change in DO for each unit increase in total phosphorus is -0.045 (mg/L)/ug.

\*\*discuss the poor model fit in results and talk about how we attempted to log transform the x axis and tried to use a subset of the y axis dissolved oxygen, but we still didn't see normal distribution of residuals or constant variance of residuals. reference the plots but include them in the appendix.

## Results Model One

The results of this model are that the expected value of dissolved oxygen across all of the lakes with no phosphorus is 10.22 mg/L in the spring. In the summer, dissolved oxygen levels when there is phosphorus decrease by 1.52 mg/L.

The expected change in DO for each unit increase in total phosphorus during the spring is -0.063 mg/L/ug. In the summer this change increases by 0.02.

These modeled results are displayed with the observed data in [figure \_\_]. These linear models assume that the residuals are normally distributed and have constant variance. The plots that test this are in the appendix, [figures \_\_ and \_\_\_]. These assumptions were not met, as the residuals do not follow a normal distribution (as seen in the qq plot), and the variance is not constant.

We tried to improve our model by normalizing the data with a log transformation of total phosphorus. The results of this are in appendix [figure \_\_]. We still did not see normal distribution of residuals or constant variance of residuals. Additionally, we tried to use a subset of the DO data and fit our model to those data [appendix \_\_\_], but still did not have promising results. We chose to go forward with the original data because it is the most interpretable.

These results show that with increasing concentrations of phosphorus, there is a decrease in dissolved oxygen, and that the impact of phosphorus on DO levels is slightly stronger in the summer. These results are significant (all of the p-values are less than 0.05 for each coefficient), but that doesn't mean they are the best model of these data. The MAPE score of 2.92 shows that there is high error when you compare the fitted and observed data.

## Model Three Results

This model evaluates dissolved oxygen (dependent) based upon total phosphorus (independent) in each lake in our subset. The hierarchical model evaluates these two variables, with consideration that each lake may have introduce differences in the relationship between the two, whose impacts should not be reflected in the pure randomness between the two variables but can be generalized between all lakes. Like the previous two models, linearity is assumed in the data, along with independence due to the nature of the data collection process. Normality of residuals and homoscedasticity are assumptions made of successful models, however our diagnostic plots demonstrate that this does not

Based on the full dataset, the fixed estimate for the total phosphorus in micrograms is approximately -0.056, and for the training dataset it is approximately -0.054. Given the fixed estimate based on the full dataset, this suggests that for every one-unit increase in total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen decreases by approximately 0.056 units.

## Analysis and Conclusion

| Model                          | MAPE |
|--------------------------------|------|
| Depth Model                    | 2.01 |
| Seasonal Model                 | 2.93 |
| Hierarchical Model by Lakename | 3.07 |

While each of our fits demonstrate slight relationships between the variables investigated, the residual analysis of each indicates that error is not randomly distributed in every model. Further, the plots show two main "clouds" of data, with clusters of points at both high dissolved oxygen and low phosphorus, and consistently low (near zero) dissolved oxygen at the full range of phosphorus levels. This, along with other efforts seen in the appendix aimed at transforming or separating data based on different indicators, failed to separate these two clouds of data points beyond manually sub-setting the data based on dissolved oxygen and phosphorus values.

The depth model has the lowest MAPE value, indicating that this fit is the best of our three we evaluate. This aligns with expectations, as depth should have a larger effect on the quantity of dissolved oxygen due to gas exchange at the surface and mixing. While the depth model is best of the three we evaluate, there are also distinct difference between spring (may) and summer (august) data as well as differecnes between each lake in the relationship between phosphorus and dissolved oxygen.

Scientific evidence demonstrates increases in phosphorus lead to decreases in dissolved oxygen due to eutrophication events in bodies of water. However, this data, along with our research, does not indicate an exact relationship. The two clusters of data may suggest that beyond a certain quantity of phosphorus, or perhaps after a threshold required for a eutrophication event, dissolved oxygen drops to near zero. Thus, while we were unable to uncover quality models to predict the outcome of the quantity of dissolved oxygen based upon our variables, we were able to see this slight negative relationship and critical quantity at which dissolved oxygen largely does not exist beyond near zero values at high quantities of phosophorus.
