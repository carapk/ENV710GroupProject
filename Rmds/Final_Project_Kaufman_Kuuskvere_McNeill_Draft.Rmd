# Introduction
a.Clearly define your research question. Include a literature review of similar studies that describe why your study is useful, interesting and situates it in the current knowledge of the subject. (~ 2 paragraphs)
b. Clearly articulate your research question.
c. Articulate the hypotheses to be tested.

# Methodology 
a. Describe how the data were collected (this will vary with the type of project).
b. Describe your data. What are the dependent and independent variables? What are the sources of data? Do you have missing or truncated data and how are you dealing with them?
c. Provide an overview of your data analysis. What type of model will you use? Do you need to transform your data? How will you check the assumptions of the model?

# Results 
a. Exploratory Data Analysis/Descriptive Statistics
  i.Summarize your data/results (e.g., number observations, measures of central tendency and     variation).
b. Statistical Analysis
  i. Discuss the findings of your statistics and models. Make sure to interpret the strength     of the effects of your variables, not just whether they were significantly important or     not.
  ii. Discuss the assumptions of your underlying the statistical tool and whether the         assumptions were met?
  
# Discussion and Conclusion
a. Discuss overall findings, statistical vs. practical significance.
b. What is the scope of inference? To what population can you infer?
c. How do your results compare to previous studies, your expectations or hypotheses?
d. What were the limitations of your study? What would you do to improve the study?
